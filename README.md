# ChatColor
**This plugin allows player's to change:**
* Name color & style (bold, underline, etc..)
  * If **"nameTagEnabled"** is set to true in the config.yml, the name above the player's head will also change. This uses the scoreboard system so you may want to keep this set to false.
* Chat color & style (bold, underline, etc..)

**No Permissions**
* Currently this does not support permissions. This was designed specifically for my own SMP server which does not use a permission system. I will be working on a branch of this that does support permissions soon.
