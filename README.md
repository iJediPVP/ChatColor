# ChatColor
**This plugin allows player's to change:**
* Name color & style (bold, underline, etc..)
  * If **"nameTagEnabled"** is set to true in the config.yml, the name above the player's head will also change. This uses the scoreboard system so you may want to keep this set to false.
* Chat color & style (bold, underline, etc..)

**Commands**
* /chat
  * Open up the chat editor menu.
  * Usage: **/chat**
* /msg
  * Message a player.
  * Usage: **/msg \<player\> \<message\>**
* /tell
  * Same as /msg.
  * Usage: **/tell \<player\> \<message\>**
* /r
  * Reply to the last person you messaged or received a message from.
  * Usage: **/r \<message\>**

**No Permissions**
* Currently this does not support permissions. This was designed specifically for my own SMP server which does not use a permission system. Branch that includes permission support: [HERE!] (https://github.com/iJediPVP/ChatColor/tree/withPerms)
